# Graph-Based Movie Recommendation System using PyTorch Geometric

A movie recommendation system built on graph-based methods using GraphSAGE implemented in PyTorch Geometric. The project uses the MovieLens dataset to recommend movies based on user and item embeddings generated by a graph neural network (GNN).

# Features
1. Graph-based Recommendation System: Leveraging GraphSAGE to model relationships between users and items (movies).
2. PyTorch Geometric: Uses the PyTorch Geometric library for efficient graph neural network (GNN) training and inference.
3. MovieLens Dataset: Uses the MovieLens dataset to train and evaluate the recommendation model.
4. Node Embedding: Learns embeddings for both users and movies to make accurate recommendations.
5. Scalability: Designed to scale with larger datasets by using efficient GNN techniques.

# Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. Python >= 3.6
2. PyTorch >= 1.7
3. PyTorch Geometric
4. Pandas

# Dataset
This project uses the MovieLens dataset for training and evaluation. Running the notebook will download the dataset for you, however, if you want to use the dataset for your own personal project, you can download the dataset from [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
